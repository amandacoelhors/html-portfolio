<hr/>
    <p>
        My very first internship was at 15, working as a receptionist at a company that built fire trucks and bomb-disposal vehicles. I still remember how often people would walk by soaking wet from testing the equipment — it made the job unexpectedly fun!
    </p>
    <p>
        When I started law school, I was already doing an internship at the city hall where I worked in the building permits department, helping with construction approvals, tax payments, and professional registrations. Later, I also worked at the local court, the public defender’s office, and a law firm — all of which, to be honest, were super boring!    
    </p>
    <p>
        In my early 20s, things started getting more exciting. I got my first official job at one of the biggest banks in Latin America. That’s where I built my career and discovered a real passion for helping people and talking about investments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2019, when I moved to Paraty, I worked for a short time at a Spanish bank. It was a small town with not much to do, so I took my first steps toward becoming an investment specialist. I studied for an investment certification (which I passed!) and started an MBA in Financial Markets and Banking — online, of course, since the nearest university was over 100 km away.
    </p>
    <p>
       Soon after, I was invited to work in the high-income client segment of the biggest bank in Latin America. I loved that job and did really well.
During the pandemic, I took a big step and studied for the CFP® (Certified Financial Planner) certification — which only about 5,500 people in Brazil had at the time. Eventually, I found myself working at an investment bank, helping clients with a very high financial profile... and that’s when I decided it was time to close that chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
        That’s when my journey on the other side of the world began.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since arriving in Australia, I’ve done all sorts of jobs — cleaner, waitress, toy ambassador, scheduler, personal care... I know, it sounds like a lot!
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now, I work as a Personal Care Worker, and I’ve already completed my first certificate in the area. I’m also studying for my Diploma in Community Services. And honestly? That quote — “you have the love of your life, and then the love for your life” — has never made more sense. Even though working in personal care fills my heart and soul, I believe I have a bigger purpose or calling… and maybe it’s just beginning now, with this brand-new path into web development!
