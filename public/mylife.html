    <p>
    Hi there! 
    </br>I’m Amanda, a Brazilian living in Sydney since August 2022.
    <p/> 
    <p>
    I was raised in a city called Gravataí (yep, it’s a weird name!!) by my parents, Paulo and Mara, along with my older sister, Tanise.
    <p/>
    <p> 
    Since I was little, I’ve always been super active. I started my first internship when I was just 15, still in high school.
    I dedicated a big part of my teenage and early adult years to sports like volleyball and dance.
    <p/>
    <p> 
    I’m from <b>Rio Grande do Sul</b>, a state with strong cultural roots. We take pride in our traditions — from rodeos and <i>gaúcho</i> dances to local food, our regional accent, and of course, our beloved <i>chimarrão</i> (a traditional mate tea we drink all the time!).
    <p/>
    <p> 
    At 27, I moved to southeast Brazil. I spent a few months in a little paradise called Paraty, and later lived for a while in Rio de Janeiro – the Wonderful City!
    Rio is one of the most iconic places in Brazil, famous for its beautiful beaches, tropical vibes, and the amazing <b>Cristo Redentor</b>, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
    </p>
    <p> 
    After leaving my last job in Rio, I felt it was the right time to spread my wings and chase something new — so I chose <b>Australia</b>! Now I’m here, pushing myself every day to learn a new language and build a new career.
    <p/>
    <p> 
    I share this adventure with my partner, <b>Daniel</b>, who’s a tech lead and full stack developer — and my biggest supporter! He’s the one who sparked my curiosity for the world of tech, and thanks to him, I’ve started exploring this exciting journey.
    </p>
    <p id="lastparagraph">
    Here are some photos that show a bit of our culture — chimarrão, traditional life from southern Brazil, and the amazing Cristo Redentor in Rio.
    These images represent important parts of my story and where I come from.
