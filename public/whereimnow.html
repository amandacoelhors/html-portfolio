<p style="text-align: center;">
With the support and encouragement of my boyfriend Daniel, I decided to start a second degree â€” Computer Science.
Since student work hours are limited in Australia and tech courses here are pretty expensive, I chose to study online through a university in Brazil.
<br />
<br />
Iâ€™m still in my first semester, but the curiosity to learn was running wild in my veins â€” so I asked Daniel to help me find a course where I could learn programming from scratch. Thatâ€™s how I ended up joining The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy, taught by Dr. Angela Yu.
This course will teach me all the good stuff: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps.
<br />
<br />
This website project started just five days after I began the course!
I know thereâ€™s a long journey ahead, but honestly? Iâ€™m ridiculously excited and curious about everything thatâ€™s coming!

Thanks for reading all the way down here. ðŸ’™
